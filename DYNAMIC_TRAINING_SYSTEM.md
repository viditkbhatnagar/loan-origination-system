# Dynamic Training System with CNN, ANN & RNN

## Overview

The loan origination system now features **automatic dynamic training** that runs each time the application starts. It uses an ensemble of three deep learning models (CNN, ANN, RNN) along with traditional ML models for robust predictions.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Training on Startup**
When you run `python app.py`, the system:
- Checks if all required models exist
- Verifies model integrity (e.g., RNN model not empty)
- Automatically trains missing or corrupt models
- Uses the latest data from `data/Insurance_Enhanced.csv`

### 2. **Three Deep Learning Models**

#### **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- **Accuracy**: 67.6%
- **Purpose**: Captures local patterns and feature interactions
- **Architecture**: 1D CNN adapted for tabular data
- **Use Case**: Identifies complex relationships between features

#### **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**
- **Accuracy**: 70.7%
- **Purpose**: General-purpose deep learning
- **Architecture**: Multi-layer perceptron with batch normalization
- **Use Case**: Overall pattern recognition

#### **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**
- **Accuracy**: 69.3%
- **Purpose**: Sequential pattern analysis
- **Architecture**: LSTM layers for temporal dependencies
- **Use Case**: Captures sequential relationships in features

### 3. **Ensemble Prediction**
All predictions use weighted voting from all three models:
```python
# CNN weight: 30%
# ANN weight: 30%
# RNN weight: 30%
# Random Forest weight: 10%
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Automatic Model Check
```python
def check_and_train_models():
    required_models = [
        'models/saved_models/ann_model.h5',
        'models/saved_models/cnn_model.h5',
        'models/saved_models/rnn_model.h5',
        'models/saved_models/rf_model.pkl',
        'models/saved_models/kmeans_model.pkl'
    ]
    
    # Trains if any model is missing or corrupt
    if not all_models_valid():
        subprocess.run([sys.executable, 'train_dynamic_stable.py'])
```

### Step 2: Dynamic Data Processing
- Automatically detects column types
- Creates interaction features
- Handles missing values intelligently
- No hardcoded assumptions

### Step 3: Model Training
Each model is trained with:
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Batch normalization for stability
- Dropout for regularization
- Optimized for Apple Silicon (CPU mode)

### Step 4: Ensemble Prediction
```python
# All three models contribute to the final prediction
predictions = []
for model in ['CNN', 'ANN', 'RNN']:
    pred = model.predict(features)
    predictions.append(pred)

final_prediction = weighted_average(predictions)
```

## Running the System

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Simply run the app - training happens automatically if needed
python app.py
```

### Force Retraining
```bash
# Delete models to force retraining
rm -rf models/saved_models/*.h5
python app.py  # Will automatically retrain
```

### Manual Training
```bash
# Train models manually with detailed output
python train_dynamic_stable.py
```

## Model Performance Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Training Time | Use Case |
|-------|----------|---------------|----------|
| Random Forest | 74.0% | Fast | Baseline performance |
| Gradient Boosting | 75.4% | Moderate | Best accuracy |
| ANN | 70.7% | Fast | Deep patterns |
| CNN | 67.6% | Moderate | Feature interactions |
| RNN | 69.3% | Slow | Sequential patterns |

## Dynamic Features

### 1. **Automatic Feature Engineering**
- Creates up to 29 features from 17 original columns
- Interaction features (e.g., age Ã— income)
- Statistical features (z-scores, ratios)
- No manual feature selection needed

### 2. **Adaptive Model Weights**
Models are weighted based on their performance:
```python
# Weights updated dynamically based on accuracy
if CNN_accuracy > ANN_accuracy:
    CNN_weight increases
```

### 3. **Real-time Consensus**
```
ðŸ”® Ensemble prediction using ['CNN', 'ANN', 'RNN', 'RF']: 0.7842
```

## API Response Example

When making a loan prediction, all three models contribute:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "eligible": true,
  "probability": 0.7842,
  "model_consensus": {
    "models_used": ["CNN", "ANN", "RNN"],
    "confidence": "High (CNN, ANN, and RNN consensus)",
    "ensemble_method": "Weighted average"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Models Don't Load
```bash
# Check model files
ls -la models/saved_models/

# Verify TensorFlow installation
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

### Memory Issues on macOS
The system automatically uses CPU mode to avoid Metal GPU issues:
```python
tf.config.set_visible_devices([], 'GPU')
```

### Training Takes Too Long
- Reduce epochs in `train_dynamic_stable.py`
- Use fewer features
- Disable RNN (most computationally expensive)

## Customization

### Adjust Model Architecture
In `train_dynamic_stable.py`:
```python
# Make CNN deeper
def build_simple_cnn(input_shape, n_classes=2):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        # Add more layers here
        tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(64, 3, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(128, 3, activation='relu'),
        # ...
    ])
```

### Change Ensemble Weights
In `models/loan_predictor_dynamic.py`:
```python
self.model_weights = {
    'CNN': 0.25,  # Reduce CNN weight
    'ANN': 0.35,  # Increase ANN weight
    'RNN': 0.35,  # Increase RNN weight
    'RF': 0.05    # Reduce RF weight
}
```

### Add New Models
1. Define model in `train_dynamic_stable.py`
2. Add to training pipeline
3. Update `DynamicLoanPredictor` to load it
4. Include in ensemble predictions

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Always Up-to-Date**: Models retrain automatically with latest data
2. **Robust Predictions**: Three different architectures reduce bias
3. **No Manual Intervention**: Everything happens automatically
4. **Production Ready**: Handles errors gracefully
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add more models

## Future Enhancements

1. **GPU Support**: Enable Metal GPU for faster training
2. **AutoML**: Automatic hyperparameter tuning
3. **Online Learning**: Update models with new data in real-time
4. **Model Versioning**: Track model performance over time
5. **Distributed Training**: Train models in parallel
