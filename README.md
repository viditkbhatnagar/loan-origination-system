## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Dataset
Place your `Insurance_Enhanced.csv` file in the `data/` directory. The dataset should contain:
- Customer demographic information
- Financial data
- Loan history (if available)
- Target variable (loan approval status)

### 2. Train the Models
Choose one of the following training options:

#### Option A: Stable Training (Recommended)
```bash
python train_dynamic_stable.py
```

#### Option B: Advanced Training with Visualizations
```bash
python models/train_models.py
```

#### Option C: Simple Training
```bash
python simple_train.py
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will automatically:
- Check if models exist and train them if needed
- Start the Flask server on `http://localhost:5000`
- Open the loan origination system interface

### 4. Access the System
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Key Settings (config.py)

```python
# Loan approval threshold (0.10 = 10% threshold for easier approval)
LOAN_ELIGIBILITY_THRESHOLD = 0.10

# Face verification tolerance (lower = more strict)
FACE_TOLERANCE = 0.6

# Maximum file upload size
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 16 * 1024 * 1024  # 16MB
```

### Model Parameters

The system uses multiple AI models with the following configurations:

- **ANN**: 3-layer neural network with dropout and batch normalization
- **CNN**: 1D convolutional network for feature extraction
- **RNN**: LSTM-based network for sequential pattern recognition
- **Random Forest**: 100 trees with optimized hyperparameters
- **K-Means**: 5 clusters for customer segmentation

## 📊 Usage Guide

### 1. Loan Application Process

1. **Fill Application Form**: Enter customer information
2. **Face Verification**: Upload photo for KYC (optional)
3. **AI Prediction**: System uses multiple models for prediction
4. **Results Display**: View eligibility, loan terms, and offers
5. **Analytics**: Access comprehensive analytics dashboard

### 2. Analytics Dashboard

The system provides a comprehensive analytics dashboard with:

- **Model Performance**: Accuracy, precision, recall metrics
- **Customer Segments**: Visual representation of customer clusters
- **Feature Importance**: Key factors influencing decisions

### 3. Face Verification

To use face verification:
1. Add face images to `data/face_database/`
2. Use supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`
3. Name files consistently (e.g., `user_001.jpg`)
4. The system will automatically match uploaded photos

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. TensorFlow Memory Issues
```bash
# The system automatically configures TensorFlow for CPU mode
# If you encounter memory issues, try:
export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=2
export TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0
```

#### 2. Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Upgrade pip first
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For macOS users
pip install -r requirements-mac.txt
```

#### 3. Dataset Issues
- Ensure `Insurance_Enhanced.csv` is in the `data/` directory
- Check file format and encoding
- Verify required columns are present

#### 4. Model Training Fails
```bash
# Try stable training
python train_dynamic_stable.py

# Or use simple training
python simple_train.py

# Check available memory
free -h  # Linux
top -l 1 | grep PhysMem  # macOS
```

#### 5. Face Verification Issues
- Ensure face images are in `data/face_database/`
- Use clear, well-lit photos
- Check file formats (jpg, jpeg, png)
- Verify image quality and size

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `FileNotFoundError: Insurance_Enhanced.csv` | Place dataset in `data/` directory |
| `MemoryError` | Close other applications, use `train_dynamic_stable.py` |
| `Face verification failed` | Check face database and image quality |

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### For Large Datasets
- Use `train_dynamic_stable.py` for memory-efficient training
- Consider reducing model complexity in `config.py`
- Use batch processing for large datasets

### For Production Deployment
- Set `LOAN_ELIGIBILITY_THRESHOLD` to appropriate value
- Configure proper secret keys
- Use production-grade web server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
